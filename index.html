<!-- MLK Facts :
Martin Luther King, Jr. worked hard to bring greater equality to 
America and ensure civil rights for all people, regardless of race.

Martin Luther King, Jr. was a well-known civil rights activist who had a great 
deal of influence on American society in the 1950s and 1960s.

King led a brief life filled with many great accomplishments, 
working to promote equal treatment of all races. 

King's nonviolent approach to protesting, his legions of followers, 
and his true belief in the ability of mankind to live in peace went 
a long way toward the advancement of civil rights during this tumultuous time in history.

In 1963, King and other leaders of the civil rights movement organized a huge march for
equal rights in Washington, D.C. With a massive crowd of over 200,000 followers, the 
march protested racial discrimination in schools and the workforce. 

Because of Martin Luther King's commitment to peace, nonviolence, and equality, King's civil rights protests 
made genuine headway in American society. 

Without question, Martin Luther King Jr. advanced the movement with his well-spoken elegance and grace.

On January 30, 1956, King's home was even bombed. Instead of responding in kind, he and his members 
took to church pews and prayed in protest of their violent discrimination.

King's civil rights movement lasted from around 1955 to 1968. Its goals were to abolish racial
 discrimination in many areas including public transportation, employment, voting, and education.
